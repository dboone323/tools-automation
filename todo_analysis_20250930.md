## AI Analysis

I notice that you've provided a template for analyzing a TODO/FIXME JSON file, but the actual JSON content is missing. The "Sample entries:" section is empty, and there are no actual entries to analyze.

To properly analyze your TODO/FIXME file, I would need you to provide:

1. **The actual JSON file content** or a sample of the entries
2. **The complete structure** of your JSON format (fields like file, text, line, etc.)

However, I can provide you with a general framework of what the analysis would look like once you share the data:

## Expected Analysis Structure:

### Current Statistics (would be calculated from your data):

- Total entries: [number]
- Unique files: [number]
- Unique texts: [number]

### Common Issues I'd Look For:

1. **Duplicate entries** - Same TODO text in same/different files
2. **Non-TODO content** - Comments that are questions, notes, or removed code
3. **Agent-generated content** - From AI assistants, build tools, or logs
4. **Backup/temporary files** - Files with .bak, .backup, .tmp extensions
5. **Documentation TODOs** - In .md, .rst, .txt files
6. **Test file TODOs** - In test/, **tests**/, spec/ directories
7. **Malformed entries** - Missing required fields, invalid JSON

### What I'd Provide Once You Share the Data:

1. **Summary of issues found** with specific counts
2. **Cleanup recommendations** by category
3. **Priority order** based on impact and ease of fixing
4. **Expected reduction** in total entries

Could you please share the actual JSON file or a sample of the entries so I can provide a meaningful analysis?
