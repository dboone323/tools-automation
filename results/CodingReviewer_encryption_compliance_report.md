- Enable data in transit encryption (HTTPS/TLS)
- Remove plaintext storage of sensitive data

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- Implement key rotation policies
- Add encryption to data backup processes
- Create encryption monitoring and alerting
- Add encryption compliance testing

### Long-term (Future Releases)
- Implement hardware security module integration
- Add end-to-end encryption for user data
- Implement quantum-resistant encryption
- Add encryption performance monitoring

## Key Management Requirements

### Key Storage Security
- Hardware security module protection
- Encrypted key storage with access controls
- Key backup and recovery procedures
- Key destruction policies

### Key Lifecycle Management
- Automatic key rotation (90 days)
- Key version management
- Emergency key recovery procedures
- Key usage auditing and monitoring

## Data Classification Framework

### Data Categories
- **Public**: No encryption required
- **Internal**: AES128 encryption
- **Confidential**: AES256 encryption
- **Restricted**: AES256 + HSM protection

### Classification Guidelines
- Personal identifiable information (PII): Confidential
- Financial data: Restricted
- Health information: Restricted
- Authentication credentials: Restricted

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Encryption Alerts
