- Implement proper encryption for sensitive data
- Add input validation for all user inputs
- Remove hardcoded secrets and use secure storage

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- Implement certificate pinning for network requests
- Add GDPR compliance features (consent, data deletion)
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Long-term (Future Releases)
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Add automated security testing to CI/CD
- Conduct regular security audits
- Implement security headers and CSP
