## SDK Features Validated

### Core API Coverage
- ✅ Server status and health checks
- ✅ Agent management (list, register, status)
- ✅ Task management (submit, status, cancel, list)
- ✅ AI features (code analysis, generation, performance prediction)
- ✅ Plugin system (list, install, manage)
- ✅ Webhook integration (register, manage)

### Language-Specific Features
- ✅ Python: Async/await, type hints, CLI interface
- ✅ TypeScript: Promises, strong typing, Axios integration
- ✅ Go: Goroutines, error handling, REST client

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ Unit test coverage > 80%
- ✅ Integration tests with mock servers
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Performance**: Regular performance benchmarking across all SDKs
2. **Update Dependencies**: Keep language-specific dependencies current
3. **Expand Examples**: Add more comprehensive usage examples
4. **API Consistency**: Maintain API parity across all language SDKs

## Next Steps

- Deploy SDKs to package repositories (PyPI, npm, Go modules)
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Set up automated SDK testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Gather community feedback and feature requests
