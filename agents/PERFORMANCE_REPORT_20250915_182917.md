## System Overview
This report contains performance metrics and analysis for the automated agent system.

## Current Metrics

### System Resources
- CPU Usage: Check agent logs for current values
- Memory Usage: Check agent logs for current values
- Disk Usage: Check agent logs for current values
- Process Count: Check agent logs for current values

### Agent Status
- Running Agents: Check agent_status.json for current status
- Task Queue: Check task_queue.json for pending/completed tasks

## Performance Analysis

### Trends
- Average CPU Usage (last 10 measurements)
